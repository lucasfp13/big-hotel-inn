# Big Hotel Inn

A simple hotel management dashboard for a great hotel at Caruaru-PE, Brazil.

## Proposal

The intention here is to connect this front-end project (Next.js + Typescript + Tailwind) with the server in lucasfp13/guava-inn-20 (Ruby).

## Getting started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
